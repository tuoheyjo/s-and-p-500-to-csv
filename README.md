# db_stock_fuctions ![build_status](https://travis-ci.org/flynneva/db_stock_functions.svg?branch=master)
this repo is currently under development.

right now all this does is scrape the list of the s and p 500 from wikipedia and then put it in the /data directory in a csv file. 

i've configured this to be built with travis-ci too automatically everyday for the time being.

maybe someday this can be useful to someone else.
